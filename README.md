# 👋 Hi, I'm N4zZa

Welcome to my little corner on GitHub.  
No suits or ties here... just terminals, coffee, and some C++ madness.

## 🐧 Linux | 🔐 Hacking | ⚙️ C++

My three digital passions:

- 🐧 **Linux Enthusiast:** Living in the terminal... any distro that lets me break things creatively.
- 🔍 **Ethical Hacking:** Scanning networks, finding vulnerabilities... all legal, relax 😁.
- ⚙️ **C++ Explorer:** I'd rather fight with pointers than give up.
